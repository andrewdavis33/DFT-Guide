# DFT-Guide

The following text is an initiative to try and better explain the intuition of 
the Discrete Fourier Transform.  Signal processing is a challenging field for newcomers,
especially for musicians and composers, yet offers a wealth of possibilities for
audio exploration.  The following guide attempts to explain the important principles
of the DFT in the context of audio.

The guide can be viewed as a pdf.  The file name is dftGuide.pdf.
