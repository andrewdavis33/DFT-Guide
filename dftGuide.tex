\title{An Intuitive Guide to the Discrete Fourier Transform in Audio}
\author{Andrew Davis}

\begin{document}
	\maketitle
	
	The Discrete Fourier Transform is an integral part of digital signal applications for music.  Understanding the
	inner workings of the Discrete Fourier Transform  will lead to a more complete understanding of filter
	design, spectral processing, pitch shifting, time stretching, and a host of other digital audio effects.  The 
	purpose of this document is to approach the Discrete Fourier Transform from an intuitive perspective and to
	consider it solely in the domain of audio.  One should understand, however, that the Discrete 
	Fourier Transform 
	has applications in many domains and is one of the great tools for solving complex scientific and 
	mathematical problems.
